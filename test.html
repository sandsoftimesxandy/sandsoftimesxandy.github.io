<h2>How to Display Error in PHP</h2>
<p>Generally by default, php doesnot show error on the browser. It simply says <strong>page isn&#39;t working</strong> instead. Inorder to visualize the error in code in browser. You&#39;ve to do some basic changes. Initially create a new file with name <code>display-error.php</code>. In this file write this php function.</p>
<pre><code>echo phpinfo()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre><p>It will display all the information related to php.
<img src="/assets/images/clt/display-error-in-php/1.png" alt="1"></p>
<p>Now, find the <code>Loaded Configuration File</code> and its <strong>path</strong>. In this case, it is <code>/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini</code>. Open this file on your terminal and find the keyword <strong>display_errors</strong> it will be set <strong>off</strong> initially. Write <strong>on</strong> infront of it. Then simply restart your apache-server. After the restart, write a php code in any of your file with some syntax error. Go to browser and this time, you&#39;ll see the actual error being displayed. I&#39;ve a code below:</p>
<pre><code><span class="php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// echo phpinfo();</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// echo "Hello";</span>
$num=<span class="hljs-number">50</span>K
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> $num*<span class="hljs-number">50</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><p>The above code has a syntax error and will display error on the browser like,

They are made in html, while the username and password we enter in the fields is taken to server via the use of php. So both of them are of equal importance......

	<br>
	React is one of the readily used framework when it comes to `web` or `mobile`  application developmenmt. So far, i've seen two ways of working in react. The first one is the basic one with 
node pakage execute `npx` which will give you the all react framework files and the second one
is with `vite`. Vite provide you the light files structure by excluding all the un-necessary react 
files at the start.

	Here is an old blog of mine from wordpress site. I did write some types of sentences with examples in it. It was an assignment for my friend. As i left the wordpress so i though to keep this blog as a memory here. It was quite useful at that time, it might be for some people now. Anyways, hope you'll get to know something from it.

	Transferring an old blog from wordpress to here. When i was a "Freshie" in my university. We used to write some blogs on basic topics. One day i was sitting in COLAB(A sort of working environment not the literal LAB) and i was not getting any idea about what to write so i choose the simplest topic haha Computers, Hardwares and Softwares and wrote a whole blog on it. I found it on the other site which i don't use so i thought to put it here more like a memory.

	Just like the other data structures, **STACK** has multiple applications. Here is one of them for the evaluation of **post-fix** Expression. The code is mentioned in the separate portions for better understanding. Better is you put the complete code in a single file with a `cpp` extension and run it then. Here is the code, take a look at it,

	<details>
  <summary>**Type casting is the conversion from one dataype to another.** PHP also allow type casting. We can convert from various datatypes e.g int to float or int to string e.t.c. Here i've solved various examples in which i'm switching between multiple dataypes,</summary>



```
<?php
$a=true;
$a=(string) $a;

$b="300";
$b=(int) $b;

$c=1;
$c= (float) $c;

$d="abc";
$d=(boolean) $d;

$e=10;
$e=(array) $e;

$f=20;
$f=(object) $f;

// $x=["30"];
// $x=(string) $x;
// var_dump($x);
?>
```

Also, keep in mind array to string conversion is directly not allowed in php. You'll get an error like this,
