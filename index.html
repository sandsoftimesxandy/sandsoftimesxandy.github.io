	<br>
	Conditional statements in php are almost similar to **C++**. You write if, else followed by a **small parenthesis** with condition in it and then opening and closing **curly-brackets** in the end. I've solved some basic examples in my IDE. Let me share the explaination and code with you......

	PHP and HTML are totally different languages. PHP is a server-side language while the HTML is a client-side language. However the interaction between these two is very important. We make the interface in html while and we write the logic in php. The simple example of it is the sign-up boxes. They are made in html, while the username and password we enter in the fields is taken to server via the use of php. So both of them are of equal importance......

	<br>
	React is one of the readily used framework when it comes to `web` or `mobile`  application developmenmt. So far, i've seen two ways of working in react. The first one is the basic one with 
node pakage execute `npx` which will give you the all react framework files and the second one
is with `vite`. Vite provide you the light files structure by excluding all the un-necessary react 
files at the start.

	Here is an old blog of mine from wordpress site. I did write some types of sentences with examples in it. It was an assignment for my friend. As i left the wordpress so i though to keep this blog as a memory here. It was quite useful at that time, it might be for some people now. Anyways, hope you'll get to know something from it.

	Transferring an old blog from wordpress to here. When i was a "Freshie" in my university. We used to write some blogs on basic topics. One day i was sitting in COLAB(A sort of working environment not the literal LAB) and i was not getting any idea about what to write so i choose the simplest topic haha Computers, Hardwares and Softwares and wrote a whole blog on it. I found it on the other site which i don't use so i thought to put it here more like a memory.

	Queue is also one of the famous data structure. Although it is pretty similar to stack but it has its own applications. You might know the working law of Queue **"THE-FIFO-Principal"**. Here i've defined some rules of queue alongside with its implementaion in `c++`/

	<br>
	Just like the other data structures, **STACK** has multiple applications. Here is one of them for the evaluation of **post-fix** Expression. The code is mentioned in the separate portions for better understanding. Better is you put the complete code in a single file with a `cpp` extension and run it then. Here is the code, take a look at it,

	Bubble sort is a very famous algorithm for sorting numbers. It is commonly used to sort numbers in ascending order. It works totally same here just like the other high level programming languages. Althought coding in 16-bit seems quite difficult but witha a little practice and understanding you can write any code in it. Here is the code,

	<br>
	I use the Windows operating system mainly for playing video games. Recently i faced this issue of disk space auto filling up whenever the os got updates resulting in lower remaining space in the os drive. Eventually i've to replace the windows with a new one every 2 or 3 years which was a headache.
